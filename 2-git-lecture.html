  <h2>The Value of GitHub</h2>
</div>
<div class="lessons">
  <p>Nearly all web programmers today use GitHub, or a similar application, to help them do three things well:  </p>
  
  <div style="width: 31%; float: left; margin-right: 2%">
 <h3 class="center"><i class="fa fa-code-fork fa-3x center" aria-hidden="true" ></i>
  <br><br> <strong>Version Control</strong></h3>
  <p>Every edit of the project is saved so you can go back and track changes.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div style="width: 31%; float: left; margin-right: 2%">
    <h3 class="center"><i class="fa fa-lock fa-3x center" aria-hidden="true" ></i>
   <br><br> One Safe Place</h3>
  <p>When working on more than one computer, this creates one location for all the files to be for easy editings. </p>
  </div>
  
  <div style="width: 31%; float: left; margin-right: 2%">
    <h3 class="center"><i class="fa fa-users fa-3x center" aria-hidden="true" ></i>
   <br><br>
  <strong>Collaboration</strong></h3>
  <p>When working with others, having a method you can both edit the same set of files it absolutely necessary. </p>

<h3>Important Terms</h3>
<p>Common works related to this subject that may be new for you: </p>
<ul class="callout-push">
  <li>
    <p><strong>Git</strong> — The open-source system used for version control. Created by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Linus+Trovalds&oq=Linus+Trovalds" target="_blank">Linus Trovalds</a> in 2005, who also  created Linux.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GitHub</strong> — A company that created an easy way to manage Git and the name of their software.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GitHub.com</strong> — The website where users can view all code projects online.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GitHub Desktop</strong> — An application that is installed on your computer which is the easiest way to post code to GitHub.com.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Repo</strong>  — Short for repository<br>
      </p>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>Repository</strong>  — Is the project's folder and all the files, documentation, and versions saved.  </p>
  </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Commit</strong>  — Fancy term used referring to saving the latest changes to a new version. </p>
    </li>
</ul>

  <h2>See GitHub in Action</h2>
</div>
<div class="lessons">

  <p>Before having you jump into GitHub, here is an overview of the development process to help you understand how all of this works. </p>
  <p>Jenny has been learning  HTML &amp; CSS to create her first web page. She created a simple web page listing her favorite pizza toppings. She has been told about GitHub and wants to see how this can help as she creates larger web projects for herself and clients. </p>
  <h3 class="center">GitHub makes Web Hosting Easy. <br>
    <br>
  </h3>
  <p>Since Jenny has just learned about GitHub and created her first web page, she went to GitHub.com and signed up for a free account. She  then downloaded and installed GitHub  Desktop. Once she had the necessary software, she was ready to learn how to use GitHub. </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Posting  First Project</h3>
  <p>On her  computer,  Jenny has a folder with her web files called <strong><em>favorite-pizza-toppings</em></strong> that contains all of  her HTML &amp; CSS files with an image. All she has to do to post her project onto GitHub, is to drag and drop the<strong><em> favorite-pizza-toppings</em></strong><em><strong> </strong></em>folder onto the GitHub Desktop application. </p>
  <p><a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/drag-github.jpg" width="640"  alt=""/></a></p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Creating New Repository</h3>
  <p>Since this is a new project within GitHub, there will be an alert box that pops up stating that this is a new project folder for GitHub&#8212;don't worry, this is normal and good. </p>
  <p>In order to <em>create a git repository her, </em>Jenny clicks <strong>Create and Add</strong>. </p>
  <p><a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/github-alert.jpg" width="640"  alt=""/></a></p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Review Project Inventory</h3>
  <p>GitHub has just reviewed her project folder and has taken inventory of all the files associated with it. She can click through each file and image to see what is being uploaded. </p>
  <p>&lt;IMAGE - Clicking through files&gt;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Adding Summary &amp; Description</h3>
  <p>Every version of this project that Jenny wishes to commit changes to, needs  a Summary and Description for this project. </p>
  <p>This would be a good example: </p>
  <p><strong><em>&lt;Add into Image&gt;</em></strong></p>
  <p><em><strong>Summary: First Draft</strong></em></p>
  <p><em><strong>Description: Created simple web page with a heading, unordered list, and a photo with a simple CSS layout. </strong></em><strong></strong></p>
  <p>Every time  a version is committed (aka saved), she'll need to  add a Summary and Description of the changes she made. Since this is her first draft, she is keeping it simple. </p>
  <p>Once Jenny is ready to upload her files, she simply clicks, <strong>Commit and Sync Master</strong>.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Committing Changes</h3>
  <p>Since this is the first time Jenny is publishing this project onto GitHub, it will ask this only time for a Name and Description for this project. This can seem a little redundant, but this should be the name of this project and a more general description of it. This typically doesn't change throughout the project development and will help label this project on GitHub. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Summary: Favorite Pizza Toppings</em></strong></p>
  <p> <em><strong>Description: Single web page using HTML &amp; CSS, listing my favorite pizza toppings. </strong></em><strong></strong></p>
  <p><img src="../nav/crap5.png" width="606" height="323"></p>
  <p>GitHub's is free for posting your files publically and you can keep your files private if you pay a monthly fee ($7/month). A lot of people that are new to this industry feel protective of their files and want to keep them to themselves. But is nearly all cases, there is little you are doing now that can't easily be recreated by other professionals and there are always other ways of stealing your code if necessary. Try not to get too wrapped up with this. </p>
  <p>When  Jenny is ready to post her files to GitHub, she simply clicks <strong>Publish Repository</strong>.  </p>
  <p>At this time, Jenny's files are being uploaded to GitHub.com.</p>
  <hr>
  See, this isn't so difficult!  :)  </div>

<div class="title">
  <h2>Finding your Files</h2>
</div>
<div class="lessons">
  <p>Now that Jenny has published her first repository, she has it in two places:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Local repository on your computer</strong> — Jenny can work on this repository without an Internet connection using GitHub Desktop. As she gets to certain steps in your project development, she can commit (save) here changes onto GitHub.com</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Remote repository on GitHub.com</strong> — Her project will be stored online so she can access it from any other computer or even  send friends links to her repository on GitHub.com so they can see her code and make new reversions with changes that she can review.    </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>Let's find her GitHub.com Repo</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Once the files are posted online, Jenny can log into GitHub and see all of her files online. </h3>
  <h3>Keeping Files Safe</h3>
  <p>If for any reason her work computer failed, she simply can download her entire project back to any computer. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Create Readme</h3>
  <p>Create new Readme file</p>
  <p>Commit</p>
  <p>Back in Desktop - Sync</p>
  <p>Find new readme in folder. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Creating Updated  </h3>
  <p>Make update to HTML and CSS page. </p>
  <p>Open GitHub Desktop to see recignized changes. </p>
  <p>Push new commit &amp; new desciption</p>
  <p>See changes online. </p>
  <p>Make changes, commit often, repeat. </p>

  <h2>Getting code from GitHub.com</h2>
  <p>If you want to get some code from GitHub.com onto your computer or synchronize changes between multiple computers, you&rsquo;ll need to either pull changes or clone a repository:</p>
  <p><strong>Clone a repository</strong> — Jenny just got home and wants to move the project onto her home computer. <br>
  Click the &ldquo;Clone in Desktop&rdquo; button on GitHub.com to create a new copy of a repository on your computer.</p>
  <p><strong>Pull changes</strong> — As Jenny moves back and forth between her Work and Home computers, she'll need to make sure she is always working with the latest project. </p>
